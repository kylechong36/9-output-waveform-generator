This code gives an unfinished version to control an Arduino UNO REV3. The REV3 will then control an ATMega328p that will also control an 
AD9833BRMZ. We will be controlling the ATMega328p with Parallel interface and the AD9833BRMZ with SPI. There will also be a PGA (Programmable Gain OP-AMP)
that will be coded using SPI. After the outputted waveform will eventually go through an amplifier which will eventually go to a load. The project was designed 
to be completely computer controlled and eventually fitted to a PCB.
